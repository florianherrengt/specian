      What I found really unique about Florian was that as a developer his ability to communicate to someone like myself, who is considered a 'non-techie' was incredible. He was able to break everything down in laymen terms and provide transparency at every point of the journey.

      Aline worked in my team and pretty much from day one was a net contributor and that was the case all the way till she decided to feed the entrepreneurial seed she’d found in herself. She’s diligent, patient, attentive, personable, analytical and human.

      It's rare to come across commercially minded engineers and much rarer to come across some with such high talent - that is who Florian is in. The ability to clearly see and contribute to the other side of the table is an incredible value add for any team. A true gift to work with.

      Aline is an absolute pleasure to work with. She is able to identify and resolve programming problems in a quality and timely manner. She is never daunted by the size of task thrown at her and takes a systematic approach to development. On top of this she is a great personality to have around.
